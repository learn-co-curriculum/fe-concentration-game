# Concentration Card Game

This challenge asks that you work in teams to create a memory card game where in the browser you can hover over each card to flip it and reveal an image. You must use the sprite imagecards.png that is provided for you in the images folder and write the proper CSS to get the cards to behave as rollover images.

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your Fork.
2. cd into your locally cloned copy.
3. Write the necessary CSS in the css/style.css file to select the cards .c1 though .c15 in the index.html page creating rollover images of the cards by repositioning the cards.png file found in the images folder. You should display the same card twice on the board like the [concentration game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) where users try to remember where cards are and make matches. The user should see the back of the card until they hover. You can place the cards in any order you like.
4. Please <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">install Firefox</a> if you haven't already as it is required for the screenshot tests to run.
5. Type `learn` command from Terminal to run local tests.
